mixcloud-to-spotify
===================

Just a simple script to search for a specific mixcloud cloudcast, crawl it and find associated spotify tracks.

Current version now skips any cloudcasts that don't match the one you're searching for and writes a txt file with Spotify URLs for all matches that you can quickly select all, copy and paste directly into Spotify play queue.

Usage: 

`ruby m2s.rb`
